Journey through this article, if you dare, the road is slightly twisty and might contain a pinch of satire. So strap on your virtual seatbelt and enjoy this joyride."

        "Malaysia, quite literally, is a hot and spicy melting pot, but not like the ones in your grandmother's kitchen. Home to a myriad of cultures, traditions, and oh let's not forget, the durians - those spiky fruits that smell like your laundry after a weeklong hiking trip. Malaysia is an exquisite canvas painted with tropical rainforests, diverse wildlife, and beautiful beaches - just beware of the monkeys, as their charm tries to veil their ‘mischievous sense of ownership.’",
        "A must-visit location is the Petronas Towers, the Twin Titans of Kuala Lumpur. Why bother climbing and peering through a telescope, when you can feel like a giant looking down at your kingdom- ant people, matchbox cars, and all? Don't miss out on the Batu Caves, it's got holy statutes, golden shrines, an army of cheeky monkeys, and exercise disguised as a staircase to God!"

Singaporeans love their chili crabs and so will you unless, of course, you have an affinity for your taste buds being smacked with red-hot pleasure.",
        "Gardens by the Bay will make you feel like Alice bouncing in Wonderland, just principally lit and without the Mad Hatter. Try the Night Safari if you possess nocturnal tendencies, enjoy standing within whispering distance from rhinos while your heart tries to implode your chest wall. Surely the purr of a leopard will soothe you into a calm sleep!"

        "Finally, hop on to the Wild West - well, not so wild unless you consider reality TV and fried chicken wild. The United States, from the Statue of Liberty that lights the golden door to the spectacle that is the Grand Canyon where you can contemplate every existential crisis you've ever had, and possibly contract a new one.",
        "The U.S doesn’t just offer landscapes and protruding structures; it offers cultural experience without equal – (if unchecked consumerism and obsessions with Kardashians are considered cultural experiences). Drop by New York, 'The City that Never Sleeps,' a statement invariably true, especially if you're stuck in Manhattan's traffic at 3 am. Don't forget to visit the theme parks - because nothing screams diplomacy louder than watching adults bicker over line-jumping at Disneyland!",
        "We've reached the end of our global jaunt (and you're probably questioning your travel plans). Remember, the world is your devilish oyster, and you’re but a carefree liver ready to get pickled upon the intoxicating brew of diverse cultures, spectacle sights, and food coma - inevitable but anticipated. So, my fellas, pack-up, buck-up, and tell monotony to shut-up! There's a world out there to explore. Happy gallivanting!"

The last one probably left in search of more space, because keep in mind, you could fit 21 Singapores into London. But don’t be fooled by its size- there's a lot to do in the micro tiger economy of southeast Asia.",

Don't miss the tantalizing aura of hawker centers- uprooting your work routines one satay stick at a time.

Of course, let’s not forget how the locals cherish their vintage cheddar. So, brace yourself for some artery-clogging, soul-satisfying \"cheese tourism” too.",

Amongst the chaos of a color-bomb festival known as Holi, and our beloved dancing deity, Lord Shiva, you'll wash up...spiritually, at least.

The Grand Place in Brussels is a show-stealer, inspiring taller-than-life tales and neck cramps from straining to hunchback levels.",

But fear not, the city's eccentric charm will woo you back with a cucumber sandwich, a cuppa, and a reassuring, \"Keep calm and carry on.\" London leaves you both shaken and stirred, with a dangly upper lip, and an inexplicable urge to call lifts 'elevators'."
